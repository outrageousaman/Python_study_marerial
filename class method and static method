class Method
A class method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance.
It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. For example it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.

Static Method
A static method does not receive an implicit first argument.(self,cls)
A static method is also a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
A static method canâ€™t access or modify class state.
It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.

When to use what?
We generally use class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return class object ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.
We generally use static methods to create utility functions.

To define a class method in python, we use @classmethod decorator and to define a static method we use @staticmethod decorator
